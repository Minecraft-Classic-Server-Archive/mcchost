Features:

Everything in level prop file into *.cw file.
    -- Use makeheaders main2.c lib1.c lib2.c
       to compile the same export/import routines as used by the
       automatic backup/restore.

    Command line routine to convert level files into *.cw --> for backups.
    Command line routine to convert *.cw into level files ?

Routine to export/import level prop and server prop binary files (INI file).
    -- External program?
    -- Should automatic backup export server properties?

Model *.cw file for new unspecified level.

Physics:

Implementation:

Place maximum number of blocks in byte tx queue.
    Remainder wait on shared block queue.

    Text messages may jump this.
	-- Make sure text anti-spam is in place.
		(Only echo duplicates back to self?)
		Ghost the player? (for a short time?)

On Block queue, if user count < 2 && no-physics don't use queue ?
    --> *256 blocks packet need queue? Clear queue on overload?

More blocks modified than will fit in queue?
    --> Can only see for "me" so generation number will wrap and reload.

    Mass change can pre-supress block queue and force generation rollover.

Logging:

Add log_printf()
Add user_command_log_print()
Add chat_log_print()

    --> Automatic log file cleanup?
